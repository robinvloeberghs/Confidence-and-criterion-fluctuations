Stimulus:Each of two stimuli (a set of 6 Gabor patches) was shown for 200 ms, with a 700 ms fixation cross between them. In the first-order task, participants saw  a '1' and '2' on the screen and pressed a key with their right hand to indicate whether the first or second interval contained a pop-out Gabor patch. Then they indicated their confidence on a scale from 1-6 by pressing a key with their left hand. Stimulus codes '1' and '2' mean that the interval with the pop-out Gabor was the first or the second, respectively. Stimuli are as in Fleming, S. M., Weil, R. S., Nagy, Z., Dolan, R. J., & Rees, G. (2010). Relating Introspective Accuracy to Individual Differences in Brain Structure. Science, 329(5998), 1541–1543. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1191883. 

Difference:The difference in contrast between the pop-out Gabor and the remaining (base) ones. Unit: proportion of maximum contrast difference (1:0 white:black).
Confidence scale:Discrete 1-6, responses with left hand. 
Manipulations:We interleaved _easy_ ('E') and _hard_ ('H') blocks. We did this by following the recommended staircase value from two different QUEST algorithm chains titrating to 80% correct for easy blocks and 60% correct for hard blocks. (Watson, A. B., & Pelli, D. G. (1983). QUEST: A Bayesian adaptive psychometric method. Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics, 33(2), 113–120.

Block size:12 blocks of 50 trials each (300 per condition).
Feedback:No feedback was given.
NaN fields:We excluded trials if either the first-order response timed out (after 2 s) or the confidence response times out (after 5 s). Also if the participant pressed any key other than the two possible response keys. For excluded trials, the values of all response variables (Response, Confidence, RT_dec, RT_conf, Accuracy) are set to NaN.
Subject population:Data incomplete (lost for the moment). Undergraduate population. 
Response device:Keyboard.
Experiment setting:In lab.
Training:20 trials with feedback (the chosen confidence value was highlighted in green/red, according to the response accuracy). The 20 trials repeated if participants had not understood the task. 
Experiment goal:Examine stability of rank order of metacognitive accuracy over different difficulty levels.  
Special instructions:Subjects were instructed to use the full confidence scale.
