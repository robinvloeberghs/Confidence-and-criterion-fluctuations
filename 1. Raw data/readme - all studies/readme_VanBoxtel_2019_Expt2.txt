preprint on bioRxiv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/561548v1. This is the dataset for the experiment with the small angle (experiment 2 in the preprint).

Stimulus: 
Stimuli were random dot motion stimuli (black and white dots). They moved in one of two directions (+/- 5 deg from vertical upwards) on the average (in column 'Stimulus', 1 = left from vertical, 2 = right from vertical). However, each dot had a random deviation from this direction taken from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of [0 2.1970 3.7129 6.2748 10.6045 17.921 30.2875 51.1859] deg. Response is coded a 1=left from vertical, 2 = right from vertical. 

Confidence scale: 
Participants were presented a 'confidence wheel' with 8 options, 4 for leftwards and 4 for rightwards. Confidence ranged from guess (1) to certain (4), in four steps (see column 'Confidence'), intermediate steps in the confidence rating were not given a specific description to the participant. The reaction time was measured from the onset of the response screen (not from the onset of the motion stimulus). The participant indicated the decision and the confidence in the same button click.

 
Manipulations: 
- overall motion direction (in column 'Stimulus', 265 = left from vertical, 275 = right from vertical)
- noisiness of motion, each dot had a random deviation from this direction taken from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of [0 2.1970 3.7129 6.2748 10.6045 17.921 30.2875 51.1859] deg
- Confidence wheel flip. After each 100 trials the confidence wheel would flip on the screen. Each experiment started with the 'guess' response at the bottom, and the 'certain' response at the top, but this was flipped every 100 trials.
- After 800 trials, all trials were repeated in the same order. These repeats displayed *exactly* the same stimulus with the same motions of all the dots (not just the same stimulus parameters).

Block size: 
The whole experiment was ran in one go, but after each 100 trials the participant was told on the screen that they could take a break (unfortunately this time was not recorded). After 800 trials, all trials were repeated in the same order. These repeats displayed *exactly* the same stimulus with the same motions of all the dots (not just the same stimulus parameters).

Feedback: 
There was no feedback provided

NaN fields: 
There should be no NaN fields

Subject population: 
37 participants, mostly student population. Ranging from 18-33 years old (M = 24.46, SD = 5.14). Age, sex, and AQ score of the participant are provided in the columns Age, Sex (0=Male, 1=Female), AQ, respectively.

Response device: mouse

Experiment setting: in lab, 1 individual at a time.

Training: 1-5 trials for most participants, until the experimenter was certain that the participants understood the task.

Experiment goal: measure the level of internal noise in motion direction discrimination using the double-pass paradigm.

Main result: Internal noise depends on the level of autism traits.

Special instructions: subjects encouraged to use the whole confidence scale
