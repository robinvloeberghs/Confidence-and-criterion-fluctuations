Stimulus: Moving-dot stimulus. In a black circle (8 degree; gray background), a large number of white dots were moving in random directions 
while a certain proportion of dots were moving toward either left or right direction. 
The task was to figure out the direction of the coherently moving dots.

Confidence scale: 1-4 (lowest to highest)

Manipulation: In the control condition, the coherently moving dots were consistently moving toward the target direction. 
However, in the volatility condition, the coherently moving dots moved to the opposite direction of the target in some frames (SD = .256). 
The control and volatility conditions were blocked. The coherence level of the dots was kept updated using staircase during the experiment. 

Conditions: In the dataset, Condition column indicate volatility conditions. 
No volatility (low volatility) condition is 0, and high volatility condition is 1.

Block size: 16 blocks (4 runs of 4 blocks)

Feedback: Feedback was not given in the main experiment.

NaN fields: 

Subject population: 37 subjects (subject 23 is omitted). (DETAILS NEED TO BE FILLED)

Response device: Computer keyboard

Experiment setting: In lab

Training: The training session first explained a single trial step-by-step. 
Subjects then practiced two blocks of 10 easy trials (40% and 20% coherence level each). 
Following two blocks measured threshold of individual subject using 2-up-1-down staircase method. 
After measuring the threshold, subjects performed two blocks of 20 trials. 
Training data after thresholding is included in the dataset (Feedback was not given).

Experiment goal: We wanted to examine dissociation effect of decision and confidence responses between the control and volatility conditions.

Main result: Low volatility condition showed higher task accuracy (M = 73.8%, SD = 4.4; High volatility: M = 72.4%, SD = 4.47) while generated low confidence level (Low volatility: M = 2.55, SD = 1.04; High volatility: M = 2.82, SD = .96).
